> and web applications.With **Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)** and **JavaScript** it forms a 
> traid of cornerstone technologies for the *World Wide Web*.
#### XML
> **Extensible Markup Language** is a markup language that defines a set of rules for 
> encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable through
> use of tags that can be created and defined by users.Much like natural languages,**XML** can
> grow when users creat new elements and agree on what they mean,which makes **XML** more 
> broadly to capture intent and semantically deeper than a nonextensible markup language such as **HTML**.
> <br/>
> In addtion,**HTML** is useful for display of content;often **HTML** is used to display **XML** content
> after transformation with **XSL**(*Extensible Stylesheet Language is used to refer to a family of language 
> used to transform and render **XML** documents*).
#### XHTML
> **Extensible Hypertext Markup Language** is part of the family of **XML** markup language.It mirrors or 
> extends versions of **HTML**,which was defined an application of **Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML)**,
> a flexible markup language framework.**XHTML** is an application of **XML**,a more restrictive subset of **SGML**.
> **XHTML** documents are well-formed and could be parsed using standard **XML** parsers,while **HTML** requires a 
> leninet HTML-specific parser.
