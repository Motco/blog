### HTML XML XHTML features --*extracted from wikipedia*
---
#### HTML 
> **Hpertext Markup Language** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
> With **Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)** and **JavaScript** it forms a traid of cornerstone technologies for the *World Wide Web*.
> Web browsers receive **HTML** documents from a web server or from local storage and render
> them into multimedia web pages. 
> <br/><br/>
> **HTML** elements are the building blocks of **HTML** pages, and delineated by tags,written using angle brackets.
> Tags such as `img /` and `input /` introduce content into the page directly. Others such as `<p>...</p>` surround and
> provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the **HTML**
> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
#### XML
> **Extensible Markup Language** is a markup language that defines a set of rules for 
> encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable through
> use of tags that can be created and defined by users.Much like natural languages,**XML** can
> grow when users creat new elements and agree on what they mean,which makes **XML** more 
> broadly to capture intent and semantically deeper than a nonextensible markup language such as **HTML**.
> <br/><br/>
> In addtion,**HTML** is useful for display of content;often **HTML** is used to display **XML** content
> after transformation with **XSL**(*Extensible Stylesheet Language is used to refer to a family of language 
> used to transform and render **XML** documents*).
#### XHTML
> **Extensible Hypertext Markup Language** is part of the family of **XML** markup language.It mirrors or 
> extends versions of **HTML**,which was defined as an application of **Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML)**,
> a flexible markup language framework.**XHTML** is an application of **XML**,a more restrictive subset of **SGML**, and
> **XHTML** documents are well-formed and could be parsed using standard **XML** parsers,while **HTML** requires a 
> leninet HTML-specific parser.
#### Semantic HTML
> **Semantic HTML** is a way of writing **HTML** that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation.
> **HTML** has included semantic markup(new semantic elements in **HTML5**:`section`,`article`,`footer`,<br/>
> `progress`,`nav`,`aside`,`mark`,`time`,etc) from its inception,but has also included presentational markup, such
> as `font`, `i` and `center` tags.There are also the semantically neutral `span` and `div` tags.
> <br/><br/>
> In order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in **HTML** documents,
> and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the
> semantic structures that exist in **HTML** need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published 
> text.
> <br/><br/>
> Presentational elements are deprecated in current **HTML** and **XHTML** recommendations,while some elements,like `i`and
> `b`,are still specified as their meaning has been clearly defined "as to be stylistically offset from the normal prose 
> without conveying any extra importance".
